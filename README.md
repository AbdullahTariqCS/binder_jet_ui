# Improved UI for a Binder Jet 3D Printer
Binder jet printer uses resin to bind sand particles to form a body. This code is the front end of the controller of one of the custom made binder jet in Advanced Manufacturing Lab in Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, GIKI.
This was a major step from the previous software, which was very basic for an application like this. The design was inspired by UGS. Major improvements include:
* Animation Windows
* Real time feedback through a terminal
* Display of current position of the extruder
* Toolpath window
* G-code window to display the progress of the print
* Limit switch fail-safes.
